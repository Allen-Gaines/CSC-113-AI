## Test Case 1: Simple Technical Question
**What I Asked:** "How do I center a div in CSS?"
**What I Expected:** A direct CSS solution (flexbox, grid, or margin auto)
**What I Got:** 3 paragraphs about what CSS stands for, what a browser is, what HTML is, then "we'll get to your div question after you understand the foundations"
**Why This Is A Problem:** I needed a quick answer for my project. Never got the actual CSS code.

## Test Case 2: Debugging Help
**What I Asked:** "My Python code gives a NameError on line 5"
**What I Expected:** Explanation that the variable isn't defined before use
**What I Got:** "Well, actually, let me explain what programming is... Python is named after Monty Python... errors are when computers get confused..."
**Why This Is A Problem:** I'm in the middle of debugging. I need to fix THIS error, not learn the history of Python.

## Test Case 3: Clarification Request
**What I Asked:** "I know what arrays are, I just need to know about Python lists specifically"
**What I Expected:** Focus on Python list syntax and methods
**What I Got:** "Are you sure you understand arrays? Let me explain from the beginning... When I learned this in my Computer Science Master's program..."
**Why This Is A Problem:** The bot ignored that I stated my knowledge level and wasted my time re-explaining things.
